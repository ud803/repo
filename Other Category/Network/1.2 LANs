1. Hosts
- Desktop PCs, laptops, cell phones, servers, routers and so on.
- A host can be any device that has an IP address - an address used to send and  receive data in a network
- IP address help identify devices and the networks where they are located

2. Central connecting devices
- Hubs, switches, and routers act as central connecting devices
- Central connecting devices are responsible for:
                                                  connecting hosts
                                                  transmitting data
- Different central connecting devices perform these functions in different ways

  1) Hubs ( 모든 연결된 기기에 전송 )
  Hosts send data to a hub
  > Hub then broadcasts that data to all other connected hosts on the network

  2) Switches ( 타겟 기기로 전송 가능 )
  Hosts send data to a switch
  > Switches direct data to its intended destination
  Unlike hubs, switches can send and receive data simultaneously
  Switches are the most common device used to connect hosts to a network

  3) Routers
  Routers are at the edge of LANs - They act as a gateway to other networks
  Routers allow communication btw hosts on different networks

- How do devices connect?
  > Computers have network adapters, also known as Network Interface Cards (NICs), that allow them to connect to networks
  > NICs via wires or wireless signals
    - Wired adapters feature an RJ45 port
        Ethernet cables transmit data in the form of electrical pulses (copper wires) > in a binary form
    - Wireless adapters feature an antenna and connect to network using WAPS(Wireless Access Point)
        Wireless connections rely on different technologies
        WAPs provide a central point of access for devices that want to connect to a LAN

3. Data Transfer
  - Serial Data Transfer
      Transfer of one bit at a time
      Data can travel in a single bit stream in both directions > Depends on type of connection
      Simplex - one way
      Duplex - two way
      half-Duplex - two way, not at the same time

  - How fast?
      A data transfer rate is the maximum bits per seconds (bps)
      lowercase b means bits (not byte - B)
      10 Mbps = called bitrate

  - Data transfer process
    <<Sending>>
      1) Large chunks of data are broken into "segments"
      2) Addressing info is added to each seg, making it a "packet" - IP adr
      3) Packets travel to the network adapter, where a little more info is added and they become "Ethernet frames" - MAC adr
      4) Each frame is then broken into a data stream of bits - 0s and 1s - that travel over physical media

    <<Receiving>>
      1) Reassembles the bits into an "Ethernet frame"
      2) Removes the frame info and check the "packet" info to make sure it was the intended recipient
      3) Packet info is then stripped, and the data "segment" is reassembled in to the file that we click on in Windows Explorer

  - How does data know where to go?
      Most every computer have an Internet Protocol (IP) address - unique one
      A typical example of an IPv4 adr would be 192.168.1.1
      Every IP adr is broken down into two parts by a "subnet mask"
        -Network ID 192.168.1  -> City, State, street
        -Host ID 1  -> house number
        - .(dots) are called Octet (8bit)

      << Subnet Mask >>
      A group of four numbers that define a computer's network
      All of the 255s in a subnet mask collectively refer to the network portion, whereas the 0s refer to the host portion



4. Types of LANs
  1) Wired LANS (WLANs)
    Hosts, such as PCs or laptops, are connected to central connecting devices by copper-based twisted pair cabling.

  2) Wireless LANs (WLANs)
    Hosts connect to networks through WAPs
    To connect to a WAP, a device must have a wireless network adapter
    In larger WLANs, the WAP has to connect to a wired switch

  3) Virtual LANs (VLANs)
    With VLANs, devices in a LAN are grouped based on their function
    Any wired or wireless devices are included
    Implemented to 1) organize network 2) enhance performance 3) increase secur
    Physical location of devices does not matter

  4) Perimeter Networks
    Perimeter networks, or demilitarized zones(DMZs) are small LANs that are set up outside of an org's LAN
    DMZs typically consist of servers that provide services, like web hosting or email
    This setup allows users outside of an org's LAN to access the servers, but not the org's LAN
