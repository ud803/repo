1. Wired networks
Though wireless connections are gaining in popularity, we still depend on wired networks to send our data
  -The most common type of wire used in networking is made of copper
  -The cable we rely on to send our data at ultra fast speeds is made of glass fiber


2. Twisted Pair Cables (TPC)
  Most common cables in LANs
    -fast
    -efficient
    -cheap compared to others
  Mtp types of TPCs, and they can be installed temporarily or permanently

  Each TPC has 8 wires
    grouped into 4 pairs : blue, orange, green, brown
    every pair is twisted
    and all pairs are twisted
    they are twisted to reduce crosstalk and interference

    1) Patch Cables
    The cables that we use to connect our devices to SOHO routers or RJ45 ports are called patch cables

    Two types of patch cables : straight through, cross over
      straight through : 양 끝이 같은 standard를 씀 , 보통 pc와 switch
      cross over       : 양 끝이 다른 standard를 쓸 수 있음, pc와 pc 연결 가능

    2) Cabling Standards
    TIA/EIA
    When making a patch cable, the wires of a twisted pair cable are placed in order
    Then crimped, or secured, once the wires are in place

3. Shielded Twisted pair (STP)

4. Fiber Optic Cables
Transmit data using light, instead of electricity.
Used when higher data transfer rate are required, or when data has to be transferred longer distances.
