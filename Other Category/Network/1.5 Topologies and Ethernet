1. Network Topologies
  Network topology defines the physical connections of hosts in a network
  There are multiple types of topologies, including : Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh

  1) Bus Topology
    All devices are connected via copper cable in a line
    데이터를 일렬로 차례대로 보냄, 비효율적임
    one-way
  2) Star Topology
    Each host is connected to a central connecting device with TPC
    Most commonly used topology
    Two star topologies can be connected via their central connecting devices to form a star-bus topology

  3) Ring Topology
    Each device is connected to the LAN using a closed loop
    Each device is connected to two other devices
    two way, closed loop
  4) Mesh Topology
    Each computer connected to every other computer in a LAN
    No central connecting device
    Setup is "fault-tolerant" - allows data to be sent via mtp pathways if one path fails



2. Ethernet Standards
  1) What is Ethernet?
    A standard that defines how data is sent and received btw devices
    Most widely used standard on the Internet today - Token Ring / FDDI
    Standardized by the IEEE as 802.3 (Institue of Electrical and Electronic Engineers)
  2) What are frames?
    Devices on Ethernet networks transmit feature
      - Sequence of bits containing a detectable beginning and end of a packet in the stream of bits
      - Include physical address information that helps switches determine where to send data > IP주소가 아닌 MAC 주소로 판단

    [begin][adr info][data][end]
  3) IEEE 802.3
    Defines carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD)
      - Devices share a connection
      - If they send data at the same time, collisions occur
      - So, only one computer can transmit at a time
    CSMA/CD allows devices to send/receive data by limiting collisions

    <<CSMA-CD Process>
      1. Assemble a frame
      2. Check if the medium is free
        a. If free, transmit a bit of the frame
        b. If not, don't transmit and repeat step 2
      3. Check if a collision was detected
        a. If so, implement the collision detected procedure
        b. If not, transmit the remaining bits in the frame

        <<Collision detected procedure>>
          1. Send out a jam signal to stop all communication on the medium
          2. Wait based on the number of collisions detected
          3. Starts sending the remaining bits of the frame


3. Client/Server vs. Peer-to-Peer
  1) Client/Server
    Servers are computers dedicated to providing specific types of services or data
    A client uses software to ask a server for data or services
    Ther server provides the data or service to the client

  2) Peer-to-Peer
    Peers are clients that have equal capabilities and resp in this model
    P2P file sharing : Skype, VoIP, Cloud computing
