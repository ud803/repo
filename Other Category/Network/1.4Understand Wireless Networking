1. Wireless Devices
For a wireless network to work, all devices must have a wireless network adapter
  -Connects to wireless access point(WAP) that is capable of sending receiving data wirelessly
WAP then transmit data over a wire, such as an Ethernet cable. through a network to its final destination

 1) Wireless Network Adapters
  Adapters enable connectivity btw devices and a WAP
  Adapters work by translating bits into radio signals, which are then sent to a WAP
  Adapters can come in many forms :
    USB
    internal adapter cards (most laptops)
    external adapter cards
    onboard adapters (motherboard)

 2) Wireless Access Points (WAP)
  WAP can also come in many forms :
    SOHO routers
    dedicated WAPs connected to switches
  WAP also work by translating bits into radio signals, which are then sent to or received from devices on a network

 3) Wireless Repeaters
  Wireless networks are limited by how far a wireless signal can transmit
  To adrs this problem, we use wireless repeaters
  Repeaters are placed at the edge of a network to extend the signal range of the WAP
  Repeaters read the signal coming from the WAP and repeat it to any devices on the network within its range and vice versa

 4) Wireless Bridges
 Function the same way that wireless repeaters do
 Bridges are able to connect devices and networks using different technologies(differnet standards) together
 This is known as bridge mode


2. Wireless Standards
For wireless networks to function, all devices must use the same wireless networking standard
There are a number of standards that define wireless networking
IEEE802.11 or Wi-Fi, standards dictate the data transfer rate, connection frequency, and more
