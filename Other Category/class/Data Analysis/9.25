# Bain Digital : Data Strategy

"Contributory Database"

강희석, Hewie Kang, partner of Bain & Company, Korea

1)
Tesla ; 온라인 게임 시장처럼 특정 옵션을 특정 기간동안 판매함
  ex) 성능 향상 1달 -> 지불해야 함

Adidas ; artifical intelligence -> automation of customization

Digital :
  1) Hyperconnectivity
  2) Proliferation of data
    : 9 out of 10 has plenty of data
    : but once they decide to use it, they feel lack of it
    : use first ! just think of how you're gonna make business work
    : then, find what kind of data you actually need
  3) Leaps in computing technology


2)
Why is Amazon better than Walmart?
  : consumers know that Walmart offers the cheapest product.
    Conversion rate -> 방문 시 구매로 이어질 확률
      Amazon.com : 35 %
      Walmart.com : 15%
    Why? -> conveninence, loyalty

"Agile approach"
  speed matters more than the direction!

"Aligned vision"
  Aligned vision btw Data and Business

"Consumer Panel Data"
  요새는 서베이보다도 소비자들의 데이터가 더 신뢰된다.


3)
Digital is changing the way businesses interact with their customers.

"Right Data Architecture"

"3G Capital" -> Notorious for Cost Cutting

데이터를 관리하지 않으면 visibility가 없다.
  ex) Other costs in Other costs section!!!

Create the visibility of your cost.
Make a tunnel from cost to investment through data.


4)
P&G: Market Intelligence팀이 원하는 데이터를 다루도록 했음.
  functional leader들로부터 불만이 많음 -> right insight를 찾을 수 없었다.

  Market intelligence팀과 functonal leaders간에 대화 통로를 만듦
  올바른 데
  cockpit : all the data in one room (control panel!)
  champagne glass : long and narrow (low variance) prediction
                    (predictive analytics)

Predictive analytics의 예외!
  Promotion
  New Product

위 둘을 제외하고는 다른 것들은 예측이 가능하다.



5)
Amazon Capex Strategy

Retailer make money because of the ROS (return on sale)
Nowadays, companies like Amazon, they don't make ROS.
Their ROS level is quite low. (like 1%)

What online retailers do is not a ROS game, but ROI game. (Return on Ivst)

ROI = NOPAT * A/T

Typical stores had lots of assets. (Very low asset turnovers)
Amazon, they charge less. But their asset is small. So turnover is high.
오프라인 상점들은 가격 경쟁에 참가해 NOPAT을 줄이지만 Asset은 줄일 수 없음.
그래서 가격 경쟁에 밀리게 됨.
So, investment to digital. But cannot get ahead of the game. That's why they're struggling.

Then, why would Amazon buy WholeFoodsMarket?
  2 major categories they are not effective
  1) Food
    Amazon Fresh를 통해 데이터를 얻은 결과, 사람들은 직접 음식을 보고나서 사고싶어함.
    결국 매장이 필요하다!
    홀푸즈는 Growth Investment to Capital management로의 전략이 필요했음.


  2) Fashion
    Inspirational. 고객을 단순히 만족시키기 힘들다. (기존의 방식으로)
    Fashion Retailer들에게만 아주 좋은 거래 조건을 제시함.
    반품도 1주일에 7개까지나 가능하게 해줌 -> ship a fitting room!

*월마트 전담 팀만 16개가있다.

Walmart는 Amazon을 보고 전략을 바꿈. Amazon에 반응하기 시작함.
이 두 거인들이 싸우기 시작하기 때문에 다른 나머지 retailer들도 따라갈 수밖에 없음.
-> 시장의 변화!

What if Amazon comes into Korea?

sustainable value criteria

User cases - customer centricity
life-cycle
tmeliness
analytic profile


7)
Agile vs Taskforce? What is the difference?
  Agile ; They are not trying to solve the big questions.
          Focus on core, critical issues.
  -> World is changing by day.


8)
Match the incentives
Share paper templates -> Gather it!
We don't really need a fancy infrastructure to accomplish it!
Data tech tends to overspend.

9)
CISCO는 최대 steak houses

10)
Not How much money you'll chareg on the product?
그냥 break evn으로 팔되 다른 것들을 같이 팔아라.

11)
Death Valley - 사람들은 처음구매한 제품을 최소 3번까지는 구매하지만, 4번째부터는 그 재구매율이 현저하게 떨어진다 = Death Valley!

Use cases Life-Cycle Timeliness Analytic Profile!!

Don't think of infrastructures!



Q&A)
Q. Why can't local retailers develop their own shopping system?
A. They can. But they can't convince consumers they're right.
Strong consumer advocacy -> 성공한 리테일러들의 특징

Q.
A.
They used to have functional structures, now it's becoming obsolete. Each team used to have data team. But now we have to integrate them. = Dedicated data team

If we have separat business team with separat TML, then we'll have separate data team.

Q. Only focused on the performance or survival. But how the digitalization affect firms further? (in terms of sustainability)
A.
Sustainability - Economic, environmental, social
The area that I find is that economic and social sustainability is the area it's applied. What we don't do is analyzing macro data(social context data).


Q. Limitations to data collection of companies like P&G?
A. There is a tool to track down their data. (Client not happy :()
JBP(Joint Business Plan) - collaborate and make holistic view of the consumer behaviours
